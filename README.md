This project provides a text interface to interact with [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) models. The app allows users to select a model, input a
question, and receive the model's response.

## Disclaimer
This project is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Mistral AI, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates. The official Mistral AI website can be found at https://mistral.ai/. The name "Mistral AI" as well as related names, marks, emblems, and images are registered trademarks of their respective owners.

## Prerequisites
To use this project successfully, an API key from Mistral AI is required. Obtaining this API key may incur a financial cost and must be acquired directly from Mistral AI. Please visit the official Mistral AI website for more information on how to obtain your API key.

## Installation

### Using `poetry` (recomended)

Ensure you have installed [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

To install the required Python packages for this project, run:

```
poetry install
```

### Using `pip`

Install the required Python packages: `mistralai` and `rich`. You can install them using pip, either globally or inside a virtual environment:

```
pip install mistralai rich
```

This command will install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

**Before using this app**, ensure you have set your `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable:

On Linux:

```
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```
On Windows:

```
set MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```


**To run the app**, execute the `src/main.py` file.

Using poetry:

```
poetry run python src/main.py
```

Or, if installed using pip:

```
python src/main.py
```

The app allows you to interact with `mistral` LLM models in a conversational manner by inputting questions. After launching the app, it will prompt you to choose from the available models or to proceed with the default model. Once a model is selected, you can begin typing your question. If your query spans multiple lines, simply continue typing until you've finished formulating your question.

To indicate that you have finished entering your question, type `end` on a new line. The model will then process your input and provide a response. After receiving a response, you are free to initiate a new query by following the same process.

To start a new conversation instead of continuing with the current one, use the `/new` command at the beginning of your query.

To get help about the available commands, use the command `/help`.

### Placeholders

If your query includes placeholders (e.g., `$0concept`), simply type your query with these placeholders. After submitting your query, you will be prompted to replace each placeholder one by one. This simple substitution method is the most straightforward way to use placeholders for personalized queries.

#### Placeholders syntax
Placeholder syntax is designed to be both intuitive and flexible, allowing for dynamic query customization. Placeholders must begin with the preffix `$0` followed by one or more alphabetical characters (including underscore `_`). Optionally, these can be followed by one or more digits. This structure ensures that placeholders are easily identifiable within the query and can be uniquely replaced based on user input. For example, a placeholder might look like `$0concept`, `$0variable_name`, or `$0question1`, where each placeholder is prepared to be substituted with a specific value that the user will provide later. This syntax is essential for distinguishing placeholders from regular text and ensuring that the app accurately identifies and processes them during the query substitution phase.

#### Example of a simple placeholder substitution:

```
Please enter your query (or press Enter to see more options). Type
'end' as the sole content of a line when you have finished.
> What is $0concept? Define it briefly.
end

Please indicate the value of $0concept
> the enlightenment
Placeholder substituted successfully

...processing query
```
#### Automatic Generation of Multiple Queries
For more advanced usage, if your query includes placeholders and you wish to conduct multiple related queries in a single execution, you can use the `/for` command with the format `/for value1,value2,value3`. This allows the app to replace the placeholders with the indicated values before processing the queries. This feature is especially useful for efficiently conducting a series of related queries without the need to restart the process for each new input, thus enhancing the user experience and efficiency when interacting with the system.

#### Example of an advanced query with the `/for` command:

```
Please enter your query (or press Enter to see more options). Type
'end' as the sole content of a line when you have finished.
> What is $0concept? Define it briefly.
end

Please indicate the value of $0concept
> /for the enlightenment,the baroque,the renaissance
Placeholders substituted successfully

...processing query
```

### Exiting the program

To exit the program, simply leave the question blank and write `exit` in the next menu.



### Features

This application offers the following features:

- Interactive model selection.
- Input validation and error handling.
- Display of model interactions with time-stamps and role indicators.
- Loading of previous conversations, in their original state or edited by the user.
- Support for entering debug mode.

### Debugging

This application includes debugging functionalities using the command `/debug`. This allows inspect the `chat_response` object returned by the Mistral API.

### Development

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Risk of Force Push!

If you have local changes that you don‚Äôt want to lose, please don't use `git pull` or `git fetch`. These commands can overwrite local changes if not used carefully. Also, with the new version management updates, there might be changes that rewrite the project's history in the remote repository to clearly define version change points.

Thanks for your understanding and patience as we make these improvements. If you have any questions or need help navigating the changes, feel free to reach out.

#### üöÄ Project Management Update

To improve how we manage versions and document changes, we're making some important changes:

- **Establishing Version Change Points**: Moving forward, significant versions of the project will be clearly marked in the git history. This makes it easier to navigate the project's different stages and access specific versions.

- **Introducing a Detailed Changelog**: A `CHANGELOG.md` is now part of the project. It will list modifications, new features, and fixes for each release, giving everyone a clear view of how the project evolves.


#### Development dependencies

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management and dependency handling. To set up the development environment and
install required tools, run:

```
poetry install --with dev
```

The development dependencies include `mypy` for static type checking.
